## Use case

Ubuntu is a simple to use and very straight-forward distro, being by default installed with the GNOME desktop environment being an amazing place to start for beginners and will always welcome more advanced users.

## Package Manager

Ubuntu uses apt as it's primary package manager along with tools like apt-get, aptitude and dpkg.

## My issues with Ubuntu

I've never really ran into some serious issues using Ubuntu I don't know why or how but Ubuntu with GNOME seems to be my safe place in the whole Linux world, boring but safe.
I've used it as a workstation, I've used it to daily drive in my main computers where I used it to edit videos, photos, game on and everything in between.
