## Use case

Arch is an independently developed operation system targeted for more advanced Linux users. It has a rolling release system meaning that there is no version of arch instead updates to system are provided constantly.

## Package Manager

Arch uses pacman, a home-grown package manager.

## My issues with Arch

Arch is a very bare bone OS coming only with the minimum necessary to get the system up and running depending on the type of install that the user is looking for.

I run Arch with Hyprland on my notebook for development only and I'm really happy with it, it works flawlessly and does everything that I want it to do. However on my desktop where I wanted a more familiar experience I installed Arch alongside Plasma by KDE and it was fine for most part. Untill I ran into an issue where SDDM just exploded and I couldn't do anything about it.
