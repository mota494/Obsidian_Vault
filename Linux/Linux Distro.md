A Linux distribution or often abbreviated to "Distro" is an operating system that includes the Linux kernel for its kernel functionality.

Distros can have a multitude of functionality and purposes, to personal computer usage, servers, embedded systems, super computers and more niche uses like music players and phones like the Android system.

Distributions are amazing tools for developers and are not trying to compete with the corporate Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS. Although there are some disadvantages of using Linux for a personal computer like a lack of some programs or not being as straightforward as the other two mentioned it does give a lot to the user that likes to know what exactly is happening in his computer and making his machine feel more like it's own with a bunch of customization options.
