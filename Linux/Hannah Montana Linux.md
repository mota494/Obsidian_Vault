## Use case

Hannah Montana is a joke operating system and it's just a 32 bit version of an old Kubuntu release making it basically useless. 

## Package Manager

IDK??? don't even bother using it

## My issues with HML

There's really no reason to use this, it's a 32bit system, it uses an outdated Kubuntu version even when it released and it's ugly, super ugly.
