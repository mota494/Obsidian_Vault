## What is cryptography

Cryptography is the practice and study of using mathematical algorithms to encrypt information and is commonly used to prevent third parties of obtaining and reading private messages.

## Ancient cryptography

Prior to modern uses of cryptography was a synonymous with encryption, converting readable information to unreadable text that could only be decrypted by reversing the process.
The sender of the encrypted message would only share the decryption with it's receiver.
The practice has been heavily used since the development of rotor cipher machines in WW1, since WW2 and the ascension of computers cryptography methods have become increasingly more complex.

## Modern cryptography

Nowadays cryptography is much more focused on mathematical theory and computer science practice and cryptographic algorithms are based around computational hardness assumptions, a hypothesis that a problem is impossible to be solved in a efficient way, making them hard to be broken by third parties
